## The "hello world" of quantum neural networks. Code from TensorFlow Quantum unveil at TF Dev Summit '20.


#### The following graphic depicts the complete quantum data pipeline.

As of now, quantum computing resources are prohibitively scarce, and classical computing methods will be the sensible choice for years to come. 

But Google achieved quantum supremacy late last year, and further developments may change the way we train models in the future.
